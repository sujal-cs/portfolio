## 📌 Project Overview

This is my personal **portfolio website**, built with **Next.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
The portfolio serves as a platform to showcase my **projects, achievements, and skills**.

I’ve also designed it as a **customizable template**, so that anyone can clone and adapt it for their own personal portfolio.
